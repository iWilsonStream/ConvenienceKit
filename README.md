# ConvenienceKit

This branch
-------------

This branch works with Xcode 7.3, and supports iOS 7.0+

Getting involved
-----------------

This project is my very first push on github, aiming at making normal categories(such as UIButton, UILabel...) more easier to use. It would be awesome if you participate in this open source project with me.

Building the code
-----------------

1. Clone the repository in a specific path in your mac/windows:

    git clone https://github.com/iWilsonStream/ConvenienceKit.git

2. Make some change in the project and then add to the repository

    git add .

3. Commit your change to the repository

    git commit -m "your commit description"

-------------
Let's roll
